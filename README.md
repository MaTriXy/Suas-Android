<br />

Suas is a [unidirectional data flow architecture](https://suas.readme.io/docs/why-unidirectional-architectures) implementation for iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS and Android heavily inspired by [Redux](http://redux.js.org). It provides an easy-to-use library that helps to create applications that are consistent, deterministic, and scalable.

Suas focuses on providing [good developer experience](#developer-experience-and-tooling) and tooling such as [customizable logging](#customizable-logging) and [state changes monitoring](#state-changes-monitoring).

# Suas application flow and components

Suas architecture is composed of five core elements:

  * [Store](https://suas.readme.io/docs/store): main component that contains a [Reducer](https://suas.readme.io/docs/reducer) (or [set of reducers](https://suas.readme.io/docs/applications-with-multiple-decoupled-states)), and the main application [State](https://suas.readme.io/docs/state). [Listeners](https://suas.readme.io/docs/listener) subscribe to it for state changes. [Actions](https://suas.readme.io/docs/action) that cause state changes are dispatched to it.
  * [State](https://suas.readme.io/docs/state): defines the state of a component/screen or group of components/screens.
  * [Action](https://suas.readme.io/docs/action): each action specifies a change we want to effect on the state.
  * [Reducer](https://suas.readme.io/docs/reducer): contains the logic to alter the state based on a specific action received.
  * [Listener](https://suas.readme.io/docs/listener): callback that gets notified when the state changes.

The following animation describes the Suas runtime flow.

# Why use Suas
Suas helps you to build highly-dynamic, consistent mobile applications:

- Cross platform; [Suas-iOS](https://github.com/zendesk/Suas-iOS) works on iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS. Suas-Android works on all API levels and provides a Kotlin-friendly interface.
- Focuses on [developer experience](#developer-experience-and-tooling) with plugins/tools like [LoggerMiddleware](https://suas.readme.io/docs/logging-in-suas) and [Suas Monitor](https://suas.readme.io/docs/monitor-middleware-monitor-js).
- Small code base with low operational footprint. Check the source code ðŸ™‚.
- Static typing and type information are conserved in the Store, Reducers, and Listeners.
- Fast out of the box, and can be customized by developers to be even faster [with filtering listeners](https://suas.readme.io/docs/filtering-listeners).

# Installation
Add Suas as a dependency to your build file:

Gradle:
```
# For Android Plugin 3.x and up
implementation 'com.zendesk.suas:suas:1.0.0'

# For Android Plugin 2.x and below
compile 'com.zendesk.suas:suas:1.0.0'
```

Maven:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.zendesk.suas</groupId>
  <artifactId>suas</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

# Getting started

Let's get started by building a counter application.

When building applications in Suas, we start by defining the state for our counter. In this example, the counter state is an object that contains the counter value.

```java
class Counter {

    private final int value;

    Counter(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    int getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

We then define the actions that affect the state. For the counter, we need increment and decrement actions.

```java
private static final String INCREMENT_ACTION = "increment";
private static final String DECREMENT_ACTION = "decrement";

// ...

private static Action getDecrementAction(int value) {
    return new Action<>(DECREMENT_ACTION, value);
}

private static Action getIncrementAction(int value) {
    return new Action<>(INCREMENT_ACTION, value);
}
```

Now that we have both the `State` and the `Actions`, we need to specify how actions are going to affect the state. This logic is implemented in the `Reducer`. The counter state reducer looks like the following:

```java
class CounterReducer extends Reducer<Counter> {

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Counter reduce(@NonNull Counter oldState, @NonNull Action<?> action) {
        switch (action.getActionType()) {
            case INCREMENT_ACTION: {
                int incrementValue = action.getData();
                return new Counter(oldState.getValue() + incrementValue);
            }
            case DECREMENT_ACTION: {
                int decrementValue = action.getData();
                return new Counter(oldState.getValue() - decrementValue);
            }
            default: {
                return null;
            }
        }
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Counter getInitialState() {
        return new Counter(0);
    }
}
```

The reducer defines two things:

1. The initial state for the store. i.e. the initial `Counter` value.
2. The reduce function, which receives both the dispatched `Action` and the current `State`. This function decides what `State` to return based on the `Action`. If the reducer did not change the state, it should return `null`

The `Store` is the main component we interact with in the application. The store contains:

1. The application's state.
2. The reducer, or reducers.
3. (Advanced) The [middlewares](https://suas.readme.io/docs/middleware)

We create a store with the following snippet:

```java
Store store = Suas.createStore(new CounterReducer()).build();
```

Now we can dispatch actions and add listeners to it. Let's see how it works:

```java
public class SuasCounter {

    // ...

    public static void main(String [] args) {
        Store store = createStore();

        Listener<Counter> listener = (state) -> System.out.println("State changed to " + state.getValue());
        store.addListener(Counter.class, listener);

        store.dispatch(getIncrementAction(10));
        store.dispatch(getIncrementAction(1));
        store.dispatch(getDecrementAction(5));
    }
}
```

Let's break down the code above:
1. We add a listener to the store by calling `store.addListener(Counter.class, listener)` specifying the state type.
2. Then we dispatch different actions to the store calling `store.dispatch(getIncrementAction(10))` and `store.dispatch(getDecrementAction(5))`.

That's it, check our [documentation website](https://suas.readme.io/docs) for a full reference on Suas components and check the [list of example built using Suas](https://suas.readme.io/docs/list-of-examples).

# Developer experience and tooling

Suas focuses on developer experience and tooling. It provides two plugins in the form of [Middlewares](https://suas.readme.io/docs/middleware) out of the box.

## Customizable logging
While the `LoggerMiddleware` logs all the action received with the state changes.

<p align="center">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/IPNGJic.gif" title="source: imgur.com" />
</p>

Read more about [how to use the LoggerMiddleware](https://suas.readme.io/docs/logging-in-suas).

## State transition monitoring

The `MonitorMiddleware` helps to track state transition and action dispatch history.
When using `MonitorMiddleware` the `Action` dispatched and `State` changes are sent to our [Suas Monitor desktop application](https://github.com/zendesk/Suas-Monitor).

<p align="center">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Gu1kYwb.gif" title="source: imgur.com" />
</p>

Read how to install and start using the `MonitorMiddleware` by heading to [getting started with monitor middleware article](https://suas.readme.io/docs/monitor-middleware-monitor-js).
Under the hood `Suas Monitor` uses the fantastic [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) to provide state and action information.
